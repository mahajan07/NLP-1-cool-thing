It's an industry driven by the hunger to win an edge over the market; ears tend to perk at the prospect of knowing more by processing data differently, especially if it makes for a good story.

Earnings reports are one example. “A company will release its report in the morning, and it will say, ‘Our earnings per share were a $1.12.’ That's text,” Shulman said. “By the time that data makes its way into a database of a data provider where you can get it in a structured way, you've lost your edge. Hours have passed.” NLP can deliver those transcriptions in minutes, giving analysts a competitive advantage.

Shulman and Kucsko laid out three instances where NLP can improve decision-making and speed inside financial organizations:

Automation. NLP can replace the manual processes financial institutions employ to turn unstructured data into a more usable form — for example, automating capture of earnings calls, management presentations, and acquisition announcements.
Data enrichment. Once unstructured data is captured, adding context makes it more searchable and actionable. “Imagine I get a transcript of that earnings call, and I want to find places where they’re talking about environmental impact,” Shulman said. Machine learning can enrich that raw text with metadata — flagging sections that address environmental impact, financial impact, or other topics of interest.
Search and discovery. Finance is on a mission to find competitive advantage in broader and more varied types of data, but what’s missing is a search experience that’s as effortless and effective as the Google search bar consumers are accustomed to.
